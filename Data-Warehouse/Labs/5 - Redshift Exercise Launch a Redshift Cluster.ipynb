    "> **ARNING**: The cluster that you are about to launch will be live, and you will be charged the standard Amazon Redshift usage fees for the cluster until you delete it. You will not need to use the Redshift cluster in this lesson. If you create a Redshift cluster now, **Make sure to delete it each time you're finished working to avoid large, unexpected costs. Once you use your course budget, you will not be able to access the temporary AWS account you have been proviced**. Instructions on deleting your cluster are included on the last page in this lesson.\n",

# Project: Data Warehouse

## Introduction 
``Sparkify``, a music streaming startup, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Assignation

as a data engineer, our assignment is to build an ``ETL pipeline`` that extracts data from their current location (here ``S3``), stages them in ``Redshift``, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. We'll be able to test your database and ``ETL pipeline`` by running queries given to you by the analytics team from ``Sparkify`` and compare your results with their expected results.

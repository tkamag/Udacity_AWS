# Project Introduction
## Project: Data Warehouse

### Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

#### Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

#### Helpful Hints
* Many of the issues that you may have will come from security. You may not have the right keys, roles, region, etc. defined and as a result you will be denied access. If you are having troubles go back to the various lessons where you set up a ``Redshift cluster``, or ``implemented a role``, ``created a virtual network``, etc. Make sure you can accomplish those tasks there, then they should be easy for you to recreate in this project. You are likely to have fewer issues with security if you implement the ``role`` creation, setup of the ``Redshift cluster``, and destruction of it via ``Infrastructure As Code (IAC)``.

* Udacity provides a temporary AWS account for you to build the necessary resources for this project. NB This will REPLACE your ``AWS`` credentials which are in your ``.aws`` folder. PLEASE make sure you copy those first since they will be overwritten. IF you are having difficulty completing the Project in 1 session (there is a time limit), you MAY find it more effective to use your own AWS account. This would avoid the need to validate your session each time you restart on the project. However, that would be your own funds. It is unlikely that would cost you more than a few dollars.

* The starter code that we give you provides a framework for doing this project. The vast majority of your work will be getting the SQL queries part correct. Very few changes will be required to the starter code.

* This is an excellent template that you can take into the work place and use for future ETL jobs that you would do as a Data Engineer. It is well architected (e.g. staging tables for data independence from the logs and the final ``Sparkify DWH``) AND bulk data loads into the ``Sparkify DWH for high compute performance via SQL from those staging tables.

## Project Datasets
You'll be working with 3 datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

* Song data: ``s3://udacity-dend/song_data``
* Log data: ``s3://udacity-dend/log_data``
* This third file ``s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`` contains the meta * information that is required by AWS to correctly load ``s3://udacity-dend/log_data``

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
````json
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
````
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
````json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
````

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

````json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
````

### Log Json Meta Information
Data are in ``log_json_path.json``.

# Instructions
# Complete the TODOs in this DAG so that it runs once a day. Once youâ€™ve done that, run "/opt/airflow/start.sh" command to start the web server. Once the Airflow web server is ready,  open the Airflow UI using the "Access Airflow" button. Turn the previous exercise off, then turn this exercise on. Wait a moment and refresh the UI to see Airflow automatically run your DAG. If you get stuck, you can take a look at the solution file in the workspace/airflow/dags folder in the workspace and the video walkthrough on the next page.

# A. Project Instructions

In this project, using ``AWS Glue, AWS S3, Python, and Spark``, we are going to create or generate Python scripts to build a **machine learning** table that satisfies these requirements from the **STEDI** data scientists.

The STEDI team wants to use the motion sensor data to train a machine learning model to detect steps accurately in real-time. Privacy will be a primary consideration in deciding what data can be used.

Some of the early adopters have agreed to share their data for research purposes. Only these customersâ€™ Step Trainer and accelerometer data should be used in the training data for the machine learning model.

As a data engineer on the STEDI Step Trainer team, I will extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model by creating 05 AWS Glue Jobs.

# B. Files and Screenshots
## B.1 Customer trusted
Here, we will create a Python script that sanitize the Customer data from the Website (Landing Zone) and only store the Customer Records who agreed to share their data for research purposes (Trusted Zone) - creating a Glue Table called ``customer_trusted``.
